#### Tooling:
##### The Morning Pages
- 3 pages of long-hand writing....stricly stream of conciousness
- There is no wrong way
- Not supposed to be writing in the traditional form
- The act of moving the hand across the page and writing down everything on the page (everything)
- Nobody is allowed to read your morning pages besides you
- And you shouldn't be reading them for the next 8 weeks or so
- They can be petty, silly, annoying, literally anything at all.  The main purpose is to get the mind to braindump everything on your mind so you can concentrate on the main things that need to be done in the day.  All the petty stuff that you write in the morning are what is ruining you on your journey towards free creativity.
- Turn off the sensor (the negative opinion).  It's not the truth.  Evade the sensor since there's no one right way to write the morning pages.  You could even write this down if you want...what you're thinking about.  Hear it for the blocking device that it is.  
- This is non-negotionable.  You MUST do it.  Do absolutely anything or write about anything till you fill 3 pages.
- Within the logic brain versus the creative brain, make sure that you're focusing on the creative brain tasks rather than the logic brain.
- Treat this as a form of meditation.  Trust in the proces of this.  Valid form of meditation that help affect change within our lives.

##### The Artist's Date
- A block of time, especially set aside (pre-plan and defend with your life) so you can develop your creativity.
- Do not allow anyone to intervene in this time.
- If you don't have the time for this or can't make room for it in your schedule, acknowledge that and then work through those issues.  Do you not have time or are you not making the time for it?  Are you worried what would happen if you actually spend time developing something that you want to?  
- Commit yourself to an hour a week at the very least.  Watch and see how everything in the world works against you and suddently might invovle another third-party.

This is a 12-week course.  Have to do everything for those 12 weeks.

###### Week 1: Recovering a Sense of Safety

Shadow Artists: Individuals who were not encouraged at a younger age to pursue creative endeavors and must consider everything as logically or sensibly as possible.  They shadow other artists rather than themselves finding their own creative ideas.  They have to learn to take themselves seriously.  Allow themselves to play.  Lose the fear of being wrong (we hear this all the time, but it's way harder to do in all actuality).

Creative Recovery: We do not want to compare our new strides to that of masters in our field.  You must be willing to be a bad artists.  

Your Enemy Within: Core Negative Beliefs

"But I'll be so old when I finally learn to play the piano" - we decide to stay blocked instead of actually working through our problems.

Your Ally Within: Affirmations
Affirmations can help allow you do things that you want to do.  Feel a sense of safety and hope.  Saying something nice about yourself is difficult but undermining yourself is extremely easy.
