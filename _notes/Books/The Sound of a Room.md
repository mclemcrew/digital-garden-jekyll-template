##### In One Circle Bound

> "A sound recording, however, is different to a snapshot; it is linear, it moves through time, and as it does so, the voice of the place gradually reminds me of where or who it is." (2)

You're thrown back into the moment, rather than relying on visual cues to watch the moment unfold again.  There's a different sense of self within audio. (2) 

- [?] What about hearing your own voice within this context?  Does it cause a jarring sensation of self as it often does when listen to your singing?

George Perec's "An Attempt at Exhausting a Plane in Paris" re-accounts all the most mundane events that doesn't stand out on their own but still carry significance within them. (2)

> "if not the majority of these things have been described, inventoried, photographed, talked about, or registered.  My intention.... was to describe the rest instead: that which is generally not taken note of, that which is not noticed, that which has no importance: what happens when nothing happens other than the weather, people, cars, or clouds." (Perecs)

- [?] The last part of this quote is what inspired me to capture it.  What really occurs in between the noise of everything around us?  Life carries on relentlessly between the loud sounds/high times in life but is it worth recording the mundane activities?

Site listening is characterized by a selection (be it deliberate or not) whereas  a sound recording replicates the environment but this items are different in context. (8)

> With visual perception, the eye goes where it wants... As for the sound scape, it is imposed on us via a sequential system: its distinctive components are stuck in a specific order onto the length of the track, and we can do nothing about this - we are subject to this order - and the advent of new components entails the loss of old ones that can but shine for a brief moment in the phosphorescence of our working memory. On account of this, our ability to hierarchize such memory is affected. (Moles, quoted in Chion, p. 138)

There is drama in listening to an event.  There is anticipation when objective listening takes place.  Memory and imagination play a significant role in this endeavor. (12)

>"the nature of the space communications itself to the 'innocent ear'" (13)

- [?] We are often drawn into the entire atmosphere rather than by any one single sensation or sound.  When we become more familiar with a place, it's easier to hear the individual pieces rather than the cacophony of sound.  Is there an amount of time where you become once again immune to the effects of these individual sounds and instead hear the overall soundscape as it presents itself to a novice listener?

> "Soundscapes are alive by definition; they can never be static" (Blesser and Salter, p. 15)

Aurally we interact with the space, visually we don't. 

- [!] What this sentiment represents is that we don't contribute necessarily to the visual space, but regardless if we are in the shadows or not, we are in fact having a significant effect on the aural soundscape we are immersed in.

Silent and listen are anagrams (14)

What's the point of this all?
> "...to recognize the audbility of an environment is to record my presence within it" (15)

The sound recorder is objective, your ears and brain are note.  This is referred to as the [[Cocktail Party Effect]]. We are always hearing, but selectively listening (16)

##### A Day In the Life

> "We are the listening device through which time speaks" (19)

It is seldom useful to listen to the sound of a place within the place itself.  Think of attempting to listening to a recorded conversation while conversing with the person across from you at the same time. (21)

Our soundscape is personal to us. We use cell phones, headphones, etc to feed into our own cacophony of sound.  We move through spaces in two facets...one being sonically and the other visually.
> "Wherever we are, we carry our room" (21)

Listening is temporal.  You can stare at a picture all day and it remains stationary, but sound in moment by moment. (25)

We require context to ignite imagination with sound
> "An unlabeled tape is a blank tape" (Street's former radio teacher)

Alvin Lucier's [[I am sitting in a room]] (28)

> "I think a lot of these recordings are for my personal reference, so I can relive those moments and experience them again... The act of recording definitely goes beyond just capturing a texture for use as background tone or ambience in post production sound contexts. There's an emotional connection to the sounds and the places - and to some extent the time travel that becomes possible in the re-listening of those recordings."

- [?] Personally I believe that's why I'm invested in a lot of this space.  I sense a deep connection to someone upon hearing their voice and the memories I have created and recorded are easier for me to relive within a sonic context than a visual one.  Might be interesting to look into a memory context on this one.
