### Summary

Throughout his book, "The Power of Unwavering Focus", Dandapani discusses the importance of developing a sense of focus and discipline in order to achieve success.  Dandapani argues that a lack of focus is a major obstacle to achieving one's goals and that developing the ability to focus is crucial for success in any area of life be it personal or professional.

Throughout the various chapters, he discusses the ways in which people can develop their focus, such as through mindfulness and meditation, setting clear goals and priorities, and minimizing distractions. Dandapani also emphasizes the importance of developing discipline in our everyday routines and the role that plays in maintaining focus overall.  You can't live an unfocused life 90% of the time and a focused one 10% of the time and assume that you can focus at the drop of a hat.  The more time we practice, the better we become at that habit, be it unfocused or focused.

Three main topics perpetuate the argument: attention, concentration, and willpower.  By developing these items, our ability to focus will increase.

The main thesis is that the mind is viewed as a cave, it's constant and although we expand the various tunnels and caverns through exploration around given areas, it's a constant that we can explore.  Attention is like a glowing orb, illuminating an area of the mind and giving it energy.  Envy, jealously, happiness, etc are all areas of the mind and when our attention goes to that area we experience the sensation of envy, the sensation of jealously, etc.  Energy is contagious though and the more energy we give a particular area of the mind, the easier our attention will gravitate there.  Think of this as a trail that is already blazed rather than one that is covered and not well traveled (no, don't think Frost please...now's not the time for that...but you can see how quickly your attention was drawn to that quote because of how many previous times you've already attended to that area of the mind).  To create new pathways through the mind, we must develop our concentration and willpower to control our attention thereby controlling our focus.

#### Critiques
This book has received many negative reviews because of the entrepreneur bit that Dandapani has been exploring as of late.  I believe his analogies are helpful to understand his thesis and help support his belief in these aspects of the mind.  If you've watched his TED talk, this book is a deeper dive into various elements of his talk.  The book is quite repetitive, but he underscores the importance and is aware that he's using this literary element to his advantage for supporting his thesis.

#### Useful Contexts
This reference can be used to help support arguments involving focus, distraction, attention, and theories of the mind.  There is no scientific evidence for these claims, they are purely anecdotal.  Regardless, I believe they help to advance a different theory of mind that may be useful for some individuals.

#### Notes / Highlights

Life is not short, it's finite (33)

Through not acknowledging death, we put those that don't matter to us higher than those who do (since we just assume everyone will be around forever even though we know that's not true) (34)

There is no inherent difference between what is good for you and what is bad.  You must train your mind (your subconscious) to determine that over time. (39)

If you're not obedient in your external life, there's no chance at you being obedient internally. (41)

Note to myself - I purchased this book because I believe I am too distracted with things that don't matter in my life and wanted some guidance on steering this all into a better direction so that I feel fulfilled.  I don't focus on items that are important to me and I want to change that. (46)

Ask for clarification when following someone (obedience) (49)

The power of small.  They are doable, achievable...this is important in change (54)

Acquisition of knowledge != learning.  You have to put effort into the learning aspect rather than being passive about it (65)

The mind is a vast space with many different areas within it.  Awareness is a lowing ball of light.  It is an untethered glowing orb that can float around within different areas of the mind, thereby illuminating them. (68)

You are not your mind, rather, you are awareness functioning. (70)

You are not the entity of the area within the mind (e.g., anger, envy, happiness) instead you are having experiences. (80)

If we allow our environment to derail our awareness, we become a slave to everyone and everything around us (90)

Taking control of awareness within and around the mind allows us to control and curate the experiences we wish to have (93)

Energy is a pure intelligent force permeating all existence (99)

Energy attracts.  Where you focus your attention, this builds up that area within the mind and is easier for attention to go there in the future (103)

Energy = awareness.  You must learn to detach events from emotions to learn objectively from the events.  If left unresolved, this clouds awareness and makes it difficult to attend to items. (107)

Find the destination you wish to get to (actually define it in your own words) and then build a path to it with your awareness.  The more traveled the path, the easier it is to follow with awareness (114)

Mastering awareness is paramount to staying aligned with your purpose (120)

Separate awareness from that which it is aware of.  This involves understanding what awareness is (the glowing orb within the mind) and what being aware of something is (awareness traveling there in the mind and that area being illuminated which brings it into the conscious) (133)

Observation is the ability to separate awareness from what it is aware of and being able to not emotionally engage in that focus (135)

You have to practice the art of concentration if you wish to be good at it (149)

Concentration is mastery of awareness such that you have the ability to keep awareness on one thing until you decide to focus on something else. (155)

The more you practice distraction, the better you will become at it (160)

Non-negotiable recurring events (e.g., brushing teeth, meals, etc) are opportunities to promote awareness (168)

Rituals & Routines need to support a lifestyle of concentration (169)

Willpower is the ability to pull your awareness to a specific location within the mind. This is in contrast with concentration that holds awareness there for as long as you desire. (187)

Making your bed everyday is a manifestation of willpower and mastery over it (200)



Abstinence, Purpose, Focus, Time, and Managing Energy are the pillars of leading a focused life.
