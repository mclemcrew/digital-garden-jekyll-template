### Summary

"The War of Art" focuses on the concept of "Resistance" and how one may overcome this wretched enemy to achieve success in a creative field. Pressfield argues that every person has an inner "voice of resistance" that tries to prevent them from pursuing their goals and dreams. This voice of resistance can manifest itself in various ways, such as procrastination, self-doubt, and fear.

Pressfield suggests that the key to overcoming this resistance and achieving success is to recognize and confront it head-on. He advises readers to develop discipline, focus, and commitment in order to overcome their inner resistance and pursue their creative goals with determination.  Every day is a battle with "Resistance" and even though you may have won one day, the next day is a brand new challenge and "Resistance" will attempt to find new ways to distract you and undermine your true potential.
	
The book also discusses the importance of developing a strong work ethic and the role that perseverance and self-belief play in achieving success. Pressfield encourages readers to embrace their creative passions and to view their work as a calling rather than just a job.  Pressfield skirts around this, but really his entire philosophy is driven but a Lutheran perspective with a vocation for the arts...it's a calling and not just a hobby.

#### Critiques
This book is divided into three different books with the last one being mainly about the divine calling to create which I wholly disagree with.  The rest of the book relied on reiterating the same concepts through a few anecdotes and analogies to carry the message.  If you'd like some inspiration, I would suggest reading this, otherwise you might want to 

#### Useful Contexts
This reference can be used to help support a claim that creative pursuits can be viewed as a calling or vocation and therefore treated different in the mind as a monetary pursuit.   It's a weaker reference because it's not peer reviewed, but it does have merit to the work in that there are some well constructed arguments about "Resistance".

#### Notes / Highlights

Focus/understanding leads to purpose, which defines your priorities and in turn the end product is happiness by following that (6)

Uplifting yourself is helping to uplift others around you (14)

You have to make a case for something in your life.  Why are you doing something at this very moment?  To defend that, you have to know your priorities. (20)

People aren't aware of time or isolation when they're chasing a vision (44)

Paradox of support: The more you have externally, the less you have internally (51)

> W. Somerset Maugham --- "I write only when **inspiration strikes**. Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o'clock sharp." (64)

What's the difference between art and a craft? (78)

To be focused you have to handle yourself, not just the day (82)

Don't identify, rather employ (86)

What's the difference between a genius and an artist? (117)

"We're all creative." (127)

We're not both with unlimited choices.  Within the paradox of choice, this is a positive, not a negative (147)

Remove yourself from the hierarchy, it's not serving you and it only makes you ask "What can this person do for me?" or "How can this person advance my standing?"  Within the hierarchy the artists must look at the one place they can't: within. (151)

Creative work is not a selfish task, no matter what it may appear as externally (165)

> “You know, Hitler wanted to be an artist. At eighteen he took his inheritance, seven hundred kronen, and moved to Vienna to live and study... Ever see one of his paintings? Neither have I. Resistance beat him. Call it overstatement but I'll say it anyway: it was easier for Hitler to start World War II than it was for him to face a blank square of canvas.”

> “If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), "Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?" chances are you are. The counterfeit innovator is wildly self-confident. The real one is scared to death.”

> "Our job in this life is not to shape ourselves into some ideal we imagine we ought to be, but to find out who we already are and become it."

> “Of any activity you do, ask yourself: If I were the last person on earth, would I still do it?”
