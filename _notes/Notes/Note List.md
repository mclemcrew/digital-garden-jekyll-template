title: Note List
---

In here you'll find four sub-folders: Sources, Collections, Thinking, and Outlines.  I'll document the four categories below and the bits of info you'll find when you search within each one.  I have created a list of notes within each subfolder to assist in the navigation of 

[[Sources]]
- Contains a summary (in your own words)
- Contains a quotable (an snip-it that can go directly into a paper or blog) 
- Can contain figures 
- Short & succinct (stay as atomic as possible - want to catch up on paper in 2 mins or less with this note) 
- Includes the PDF with key highlights
- Questions and ideas will be gathered into this note and moved to Thinking
- No factual statements; those go into the Collections

[[Collections]]
- Created based on a topic of interest
- Atomic bits of info go here (can have information in more than one place if it pertains to the item)
- Add link back to paper so you know where you got it from
- Quickly access original source if you need
- Be succinct
- Think of it as LEGO bricks from writing
- Max ~20 facts per note.  Too big?  Split it up!

[[Thinking]]
- All (absurd) ideas, questions, and suggestions go here. 
- Birthplace of "synthesis" as multiple sources will naturally come together in these notes.
- Don't "think so much" here; creativity is spontaneous. Jot. Jot. Jot.
- Note every question you have in the lit
- Be critical - poke holes in the literature
- Note ideas for experiments, methods, testing, etc
- No dumb questions...ask them all here
- Link to source and collection

[[Outlines]]
- Based on questions (Thinking) and facts (Collections - think "LEGO" for this..writing prompts).  
- Uses only primary sources (Sources) 
- Aims at "publication grade", readable text
- Identify questions that still need to be answered and focus on those
